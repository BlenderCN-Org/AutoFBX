#AutoFBX: Automatic FBX exporter for Blender

1. Right click and save the following link: https://cdn.rawgit.com/lukeadams/AutoFBX/1.11/autoFBX.py
2. Install it in Blender User Preferences under the Addons tab
4. ctrl+g objects that you want grouped into one file
3. <filename>-groups/<groupname>.fbx will be created in the same directory as <filename>.blend on every save, overwriting already existing files with the same name.

Using it with Unreal Engine, works great!
