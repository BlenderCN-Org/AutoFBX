#AutoFBX: Automatic FBX exporter for Blender

1. Right click and save the following link: https://cdn.rawgit.com/staticlinuxpro/AutoFBX/1.01/autoFBX.py
2. Install it in Blender User Preferences under the Addons tab
3. <filename>.fbx will be created in the same directory as <filename>.blend on every save, overwriting already existing 

Using it with Unreal Engine, works great!
